# Syllabus of ML Financial Markets
## 1. Goal of the course
1. Use ML to predict fraud event in China/US financial market. Predict behavior of stocks, options and other financial products world wide.
2. Learning outcome:
  - a detailed project of how to get data, clean data, apply ML model to predict outcome
  - a detailed writeup of the report
3. prerequisite and tools used in the course  

    a. requirements
      - require understanding of matrix, basic concept of ML.
      - strong interests in data and financial markets
      - knowledge of basic python  

    b. tools
      - python
      - Tensorflow
      - Pandas
      - Scikit-learn
      - Mac/Google Colab/AWS etc XaaS computation platform

## 2. Syllabus
The course is a *12-week* course designed to learn how to use MachineLearning concepts to understand the financial market's behavior. Using a state-of-the-art ML tool and concept of RNN, we are going to build a model that can
  1. learn market behavior of certain type of fraud
  2. predict price variation of certain markets  
There is going to be small *homework* at the end of each week.
